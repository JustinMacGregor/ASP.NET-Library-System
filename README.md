# ASP.NET-Library-System
The project is an ASP.NET library system that utilizes two solutions, the client and the service. The client solution, ABCBooksClient_991471961, contains a BookController that interacts with the service solution, ABCBooksService_991471961, through a BookService_991471961Client. The BookController has various actions such as Index, Details, Create, Edit, and Delete that allow the user to retrieve, add, update, and delete books from the database through the service. The service solution, ABCBooksService_991471961, contains an interface, IBookService_991471961, that defines the operations that the client can access such as GetAllBooks, GetABook, GetABookByISBN, GetABookByTitle, GetABookByAuthor, EditBook, AddBook, and DeleteBook. The service also contains a partial class, BookInfo, that includes metadata for the columns in the database table. Overall, the project is an intricate system that utilizes a client-service architecture to manage and manipulate a book database through a web interface.
